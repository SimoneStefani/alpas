### Alpas - The Rapid and Delightful Kotlin Web Framework. Easy, elegant, and productive! ðŸš€

Alpas is a Kotlin-based web framework that gets you creating web apps and APIs simply, and quickly. 

#### Routes. Simple, and defined. 

```kotlin

import example.controllers.WelcomeController
import dev.alpas.routing.RouteGroup
import dev.alpas.routing.Router

fun Router.addRoutes() = apply {
    
    get("/", WelcomeController::welcome)

}

```

#### Controllers. Write less, do more. 

```kotlin

import dev.alpas.http.HttpCall
import dev.alpas.routing.Controller

class WelcomeController : Controller() {

    fun welcome(call: HttpCall) {

        call.render("Welcome!")

    }
}

```

## Batteries-included
Alpas strives to be simple and elegant and wants to serve you whether you have written JVM-based web
apps before or not. There is no huge learning curve to get started and Alpas comes bundled with what you'll need
to build a powerful web application or API. 

- Authentication 
- Notifications
- Security
- Emails 
- Queues
- Front-End (Pebble, Vuejs, TailwindCSS)

We have sweated picking the good parts, so you donâ€™t have to!
