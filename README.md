### Alpas - Rapid web development with Kotlin. Fast, easy, simple, elegant, and productive üöÄ‚ö°Ô∏è

Alpas is all batteries included web framework for Kotlin with a strong focus on developers and their productivity.
The main goal of Alpas is to allow web developers start writing a web app fast and help them move forward
even faster and enjoy the journey while doing so!

Alpas strives to be simple and elegant and wants to serve even to those who have never written any JVM based web
apps before‚Äîthere is no xml or properties files to be configured and there is no huge learning curve. It comes
bundled with most of what you need to write a modern web app‚Äîauthentication, mail, queues, notifications,
fast routing engine, templating‚Äîand yet it remains flexible for **you** to extend it making it more
powerful than it already is.

### Who is Alpas for?

If you are just someone who is looking to learn some dynamic web development, Alpas is for you. If you are tired
of the complexities of a dynamic web programming ecosystem, Alpas is for you. If you are tired of gigantic
"enterprisey" web frameworks, Alpas is for you. If you are a seasoned Java EE web developer looking for
some fresh air, Alpas is for you. If you are someone who wants just wants be enjoy writing a web app
using a ["happy programming language"][happy-kotlin] and a framework that has everything you need
but still gets out of your way, Alpas is for you. 

### Learning Alpas

Alpas is extensively, thoroughly, and proudly documented; and we are not talking about code comments! We have put
as much effort writing and updating the documentation as we have spent time crafting the framework. The
[Alpas documentation site][alpas-docs] has everything you need to get started and get going‚Äîincluding
two full tutorials that show you how to write web apps from start to finish with Alpas.

If you are not satisfied with the quality of Alpas documentation or feel like something is not properly documented,
please open an issue and we'll tackle it with a high priority. Feel free to send a pull request if you want,
of course!

We want you to enjoy writing a web app in Alpas. If you are not, please let us know and we'll keep it improving
until it is just right for all of us. The best way to let us help you is by joining our
[official Slack][slack-invite] and asking questions. [Please join us!][slack-invite].
